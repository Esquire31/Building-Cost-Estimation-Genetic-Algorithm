## Project Name: Cost Estimation System with Genetic Algorithms and Linear Regression

This project implements a **Flask-based cost estimation system for construction projects**, combining the power of **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** and **Linear Regression** for accurate and reliable predictions. Developed using **Python, Keras, and TensorFlow**, the system offers a robust and flexible solution for cost estimation tasks.

**Key Features:**

* **Flask Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for data input and cost prediction visualization.
* **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** Optimizes feature selection and model hyperparameters for improved prediction accuracy.
* **Linear Regression Model:** Estimates construction project costs based on historical data and selected features.
* **Multiple Algorithm Options:** (Optional) Explore different regression models besides Linear Regression for comparison.
* **Model Performance Evaluation:** Provides metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess model effectiveness.

**Benefits:**

* **Increased Accuracy:** GA optimization helps fine-tune the model, potentially leading to more accurate cost estimations compared to traditional methods.
* **Data-Driven Approach:** Relies on historical data for learning, improving prediction accuracy over time with more data.
* **Flexibility:** The system can be adapted to various construction project types by adjusting data features and model parameters.
* **Easy to Use:** The Flask interface simplifies user interaction and cost prediction access.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Flask
* Keras
* TensorFlow

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Esquire31/Building-Cost-Estimation-Genetic-Algorithm.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download and prepare your construction project data.
4. Configure the Flask application in `main.py` to match your data structure and model settings.

**Disclaimer**
This was one of the first projects that I made so there will be a lot of mistakes and messy codes. So pardon my bad coding skills and if you have any suggestions, **Please reach out to me!!**
